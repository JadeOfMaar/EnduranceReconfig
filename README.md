This mod performs the following:
* Adds plumes to all engines and RCS thrusters.
* Makes the engines and RCS use only LiquidFuel and ElectricCharge, and raises their Isp and Electrical demands to practical high levels. These buffs make Endurance much more fit for use in a large kerbal universe, whether an upscaled one or one with many star systems.
  * Makes use of Propellium instead of LiquidFuel in WBI CLassic Stock.
* Replaces the basic, high-powered generator module with convincing fuel cells and Tokamak-alike fusion power sources.
* Changes ElectricCharge tankage and changes tanks to use B9 Part Switch or WBI OmniStorage.
* Integrates parts with WBI Pathfinder and Snacks for a very complete gameplay feature set.
* Provides life support mod integration only for WBI Snacks.
